## Starting the Docker Container

Ensure that you have build the Docker container before running (see above instructions).

1. cd into `I_Go_By_Netcow_Now` directory
2. Run the `start.sh` script

You can then verify that the container is running by executing `$ sudo docker ps` and seeing if the netcow container is listed among the running containers.

## Stopping the Docker Container

1. cd into `I_Go_By_Netcow_Now` directory
2. Run the `stop.sh` script

You can then verify that the container has stopped by executing `$ sudo docker ps` and seeing if the netcow container is listed among the running containers.

## Modifying the flag

To change the flag for future semesters follow these steps:

1. Modify `I_Go_By_Netcow_Now/src/flag.txt` to your desired flag.
2. Rebuild the container using the above instructions.
