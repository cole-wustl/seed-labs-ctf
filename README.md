# Open-Source CTF Platform

---

* [Welcome video](./manual/videos/SEED_CTF_intro.mp4)

Welcome to the SEED CTF platform!  This platform is intended to be used as a companion to the SEED Labs security education exercises hosted at [https://seedsecuritylabs.org/](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/). The platform contains CTF challenges corresponding to many of the Labs in addition to a few not associated with a specific Lab.

Please see the [`manual/README`](./manual/README.md) document for instructions on how to set up and use the platform.

## SEED Labs Covered

Many of the CTF challenges are based on existing [SEED Labs 2.0 exercises](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/), and in some cases may reuse source code from the SEED Labs.
The mapping from SEED Labs to corresponding CTF challenges is as follows:
